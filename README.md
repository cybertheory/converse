## Quick Install

`pip install langbrain`
or
`conda install langbrain -c conda-forge`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. LangBrain allows the use of LLMs as a sort of computational nexus, allowing the creation of autonomous agents by standardizing the direct connection of models to existing SDKs and APIs.
